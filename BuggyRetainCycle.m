In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods within custom `dealloc` methods.  Specifically, if an object retains itself within its `dealloc` method, this creates a retain cycle that prevents the object from being deallocated. This can lead to memory leaks and crashes, particularly when the object is part of a larger application. The usual suspects are retaining self within dealloc or failing to properly release properties.
