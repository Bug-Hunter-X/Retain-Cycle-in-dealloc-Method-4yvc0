The solution involves removing the self-retain call within the dealloc method and ensuring all properties are released correctly.

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    //INCORRECT: [self retain]; // Removing this line fixes the retain cycle
    [myProperty release]; // Ensure myProperty is correctly released
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

By removing the `[self retain]` call and ensuring that all properties owned by the object are released in `dealloc`, the retain cycle is broken and proper memory management is restored.
